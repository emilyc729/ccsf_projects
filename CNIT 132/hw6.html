		<div id="text1">Origin of Ice Cream from BBC: An ice-cream-like food was first eaten in China in 618-97AD. King Tang of Shang, had 94 ice men who helped to make a dish of buffalo milk, flour and camphor. A kind of ice-cream was invented in China about 200 BC when a milk and rice mixture was frozen by packing it into snow. Roman emperors are supposed to have sent slaves to mountain tops to bring back fresh snow which was then flavoured and served as an early form of ice-cream. The King of England, Charles I, is supposed to have offered his chef Â£500 a year to keep his ice-cream recipe a secret from the rest of England. The explorer, Marco Polo (1254-1324), is believed to have seen ice-creams being made during his trip to China and introduced them to Italy. Ice Cream sundaes were invented when it became illegal to sell ice-cream sodas on a Sunday in the American town of Evanston during the late 19th century. To get round the problem some traders replaced the soda with syrup and called the dessert an "Ice Cream Sunday." They replaced the final "y" with an "e" to avoid upsetting religious leaders.</div>
		<div id="text2">Personal Experience in making Ice Cream: The first time I made ice cream was in elementary school. I remember using two zip-lock bags, one big one and one smaller one.  From what I remember, ingredients for the ice cream include milk, vanilla flavoring, and sugar.  I put the ingredients for the ice cream in the smaller zip-lock bag and in the larger zip lock bag I put rock salt and ice.  Then I put the smaller bag into the larger one, ealing both bags nice and tight and start shaking!.  After a while the liquid form of ice cream solidify creating a ice cream texture.  This was my first experience in making ice cream, it was very memorable, fun, and delicious.  As I got older, I had another chance to make ice cream again in high school and that time we experimented in making other flavors and adding fruits into the mixture.
